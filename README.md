# AHB_MULTI_MASTER

1. In this project, we have 8 ahb masters and one slave which is nothing but the testbench.
2. Testbench is nothing but the memory slave. 
3. Multi masters are arbirating for the bus based on a priority scheme. 
4. Once the ahb master gets grant, it will collect data from memory and drive the CAN module.
